**1\. What is Cloud Computing and why is it important?**

* Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing resources over the internet.
    
* It is important because it provides security, flexibility, scalability, cost savings, and reliability, allowing businesses to focus on their core competencies rather than managing complex IT infrastructure.
    

**2\. What are the main benefits of using cloud computing in AWS?**

* Scalability: AWS allows users to scale resources up or down based on demand for optimal performance and cost efficiency.
    
* Cost savings: Organizations pay only for the resources they use, reducing upfront hardware investment and operational costs.
    
* Reliability and availability: AWS offers a highly reliable infrastructure with multiple data centers for high availability.
    
* Flexibility: Users can choose from a wide range of services to meet their specific needs.
    
* Global reach: AWS has data centers worldwide for global deployment.
    

**3\. Explain the different service models in Cloud Computing.**

* Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Users manage applications and configurations, while the provider handles physical infrastructure.
    
* Platform as a Service (PaaS): Providers manage the infrastructure, and runtime environment, and users focus on application development.
    
* Software as a Service (SaaS): Complete applications are delivered via the Internet with no installation or maintenance required.
    

**4\. What is AWS? How does it fit into the Cloud Computing landscape?**

* AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a cloud computing platform by Amazon, that offers a wide range of cloud services.
    
* It fits into the cloud computing landscape as a leading provider, offering scalable, reliable, and cost-effective infrastructure for businesses of all sizes.
    

**5\. Name some of the core services offered by AWS.**

* Amazon EC2
    
* Amazon S3
    
* Amazon RDS
    
* Amazon VPC
    
* AWS Lambda
    
* Amazon CloudFront
    

**6\. What is an EC2 instance in AWS?**

An EC2 instance is a virtual server in AWS that provides compute capacity for running applications and services. It's scalable and customizable.

**7\. Explain the concept of Availability Zones in AWS.**

* Availability Zones (AZs) are physically separate data centers within an AWS Region.
    
* They provide high availability and fault tolerance by distributing resources across multiple locations to protect against failures.
    

**8\. What is IAM in AWS? Why is it important?**

* IAM is Identity and Access Management in AWS, managing access to resources.
    
* It is important for security, as it enforces the principle of least privilege and helps control user access.
    

**9\. How can you secure your AWS resources using Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies?**

* Use the least privilege.
    
* Regularly review and audit policies.
    
* Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    
* Apply for IAM roles for services and applications.
    
* Regularly rotate access keys.
    
* Use IAM conditions for additional restrictions.
    

**10\. What is an AWS Region and how does it relate to Availability Zones?**

* An AWS Region is a geographical area with multiple data centers.
    
* Availability Zones within a Region are physically separated data centers connected for high availability and fault tolerance. Users can deploy resources in multiple AZs for redundancy and disaster recovery.
