Each item you want to retrieve as a search result is represented as a document, which includes a unique document ID and one or more fields containing the data you wish to search. Amazon CloudSearch generates a search index from your document data based on the configured index fields for your domain. As your data changes, you can submit updates to add or delete documents from the index.
    
42. **How do I create document batches formatted for Amazon CloudSearch?**
    
    To create document batches that describe your data, you need to create JSON or XML text files. These files should specify the operation type (add or delete), a unique identifier, and the fields with their associated data. These document batches can be uploaded to Amazon CloudSearch using the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, or AWS CLI. An example of a JSON-formatted document batch is provided in the answer for reference.
    
43. **Can a search domain span multiple Availability Zones?**

More information can be found in the "Configuring Availability Options" section of the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide.
    
44. **Why is my domain in the "Processing" state?**
    
    A search domain in Amazon CloudSearch can be in one of three states: "processing," "active," or "reindexing." Typically, your domain will be in the "active" state, meaning no ongoing changes are taking place, and the domain is fully functional for querying and updating. The "processing" state occurs when the domain needs to be re-indexed. It does not enter this state until re-indexing is initiated. During this phase, the domain can still be queried and updated, but configuration changes won't be reflected in search results until indexing is complete and the domain's status returns to "active." You can continue to upload document batches during this time, but uploading a large volume of updates in the "processing" state can increase the time required for updates to be applied to the search index.
    
45. **How do I delete my search domain?**
    
    To delete a search domain in Amazon CloudSearch, you can click on the "Delete Domain" button in the Amazon CloudSearch console. Alternatively, you can delete domains through the AWS SDKs or AWS CLI.

48. **What is faceting?**
    
    Faceting is a feature that allows you to categorize search results into refinements that users can further search within. For example, if a user searches for "umbrellas," you can use facets to group the results by price ranges, like $0-$10, $10-$20, and so on. Facets can also include the count of documents in each refinement group, so users can see how many items fall into each category. Faceting helps users navigate and refine search results effectively.
    
49. **What languages does Amazon CloudSearch support?**
    
    Amazon CloudSearch currently supports 34 languages, including Arabic, Armenian, Basque, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese (simplified and traditional), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, Galician, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Irish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latvian, Norwegian, Persian, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, and Turkish. Additionally, it supports a "Multiple" option for fields that contain mixed languages.
    
50. **Does Amazon CloudSearch support geospatial search?**
    
    Yes, Amazon CloudSearch includes native support for geospatial search through a "latlon" data type. This enables you to easily implement searches and sorting based on geographic locations. More details can be found in the "Searching and Ranking Results by Geographic Location" section of the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide.
    
51. **What makes one search request more complex than another?**
    
    The complexity of a search request in Amazon CloudSearch depends on several factors, including the expressions used to determine which documents match and the criteria for evaluating how closely each document matches. Complex search requests that match a large number of documents or involve the computation of complex expressions take longer to process compared to simpler requests that involve basic criteria like a single field. The time it takes to process a request can vary, and the response includes information about the processing time to help you understand the request's complexity.
    
52. **What instance types does Amazon CloudSearch support?**
    
    Amazon CloudSearch supports the following instance types:
    
    * Small Search Instance

    * Double Extra Large Search Instance
        
53. **Does Amazon CloudSearch support Multi-AZ deployments?**
    
    Yes, Amazon CloudSearch supports Multi-Z deployments. Enabling the Multi-AZ option results in Amazon CloudSearch provisioning and maintaining additional instances for your search domain in a second Availability Zone, ensuring high availability. Updates are automatically applied to instances in both Availability Zones, and search traffic is distributed across all instances. In the event of a failure, instances in either zone can handle the full load.
    
54. **Do I need to select the number and type of search instances for my search domain?**
    
    No, Amazon CloudSearch is a fully managed service that automatically scales your search domain and selects the number and type of search instances based on your data and traffic. The service ensures that all search instances within a domain are of the same type. You can configure scaling options to increase upload capacity, speed up search requests, enhance search capacity, and improve fault tolerance.
    
55. **How does the new Multi-AZ feature work? Will my system experience any downtime in the event of a failure?**
    
    The Multi-AZ feature in Amazon CloudSearch ensures high availability by deploying instances in two Availability Zones. In the event of service disruption or if instances in one zone become degraded, CloudSearch routes all traffic to the other Availability Zone. Redundant instances are restored in a separate Availability Zone without any administrative intervention or service disruption. Some in-flight queries may fail and need to be retried, but updates sent to the search domain are stored durably and won't be lost in case of failure.
    
56. **Can I choose which Availability Zones my search domain is deployed in?**
    
    No, at this time, Amazon CloudSearch automatically selects an alternate Availability Zone within the same AWS Region for redundancy and high availability.
