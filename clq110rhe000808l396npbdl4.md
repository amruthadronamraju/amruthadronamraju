### **What is Linux?**

Linux is an open-source operating system developed by the community for various computing devices like computers, servers, mobile devices, and embedded systems. Its adaptable nature spans across major platforms, including x86, ARM, and more, making it highly versatile. This OS operates based on the Linux Kernel, managing hardware resources, accompanied by a suite of software packages constituting the operating system.

### **Why Linux is Popular?**

Linux stands out due to several key attributes:

1. **Free:** Unlike Windows, Linux is freely accessible without any associated costs.
    
2. **Open Source:** Linux operates as open-source software, allowing users to view, edit, and contribute to its code.
    
3. **Security:** Known for its robust security, Linux requires no antivirus software and undergoes continuous enhancements by a global development community.
    
4. **Stability and Performance:** Linux offers high stability, rarely necessitating reboots and maintaining consistent performance across diverse networks and workstations.
    

### **Linux Commands in DevOps**

Mastering Linux commands is crucial for DevOps experts as they form the backbone of many systems and tools used in the field. DevOps heavily relies on Linux environments, and knowing essential sysadmin commands aids in organization, troubleshooting, and optimization of applications. From virtual machines to containers, understanding Linux basics and scripting proves vital for a Professional Certificate in DevOps.

Here's a comprehensive list of crucial Linux commands:

1. ls - Lists files and directories.
    
2. cd - Changes the working directory.
    
3. mkdir - Creates a new directory.
    
4. touch - Creates a new file.
    
5. cp - Copies files and directories.
    
6. mv - Moves or renames files and directories.
    
7. rm - Deletes files and directories.
    
8. rmdir - Deletes an empty directory.
    
9. cat - Displays file contents.
    
10. grep - Searches for patterns in files.
    
11. find - Searches for files based on various criteria.
    
12. sort - Sorts lines in a file.
    
13. tar - Creates or extracts files from a tar archive.
    
14. gzip - Compresses or decompresses files.
    
15. chmod - Changes file permissions.
    
16. chown - Changes file ownership.
    

Continuously expanding knowledge and expertise in Linux CLI and its tools remains essential for DevOps professionals.

### **Shell Scripting**  

### **What is Shell?**

A shell in a Linux system acts as an interface for user interaction, executing commands, programs, and scripts. It serves as a protective layer around the operating system, safeguarding its core components. There are two primary shells in Linux: the Bourne Shell (represented by $) and the C shell (marked by %).

### **What is Shell Scripting?**

Shell scripting involves writing a series of commands for Unix-based shells to execute. It simplifies lengthy and repetitive commands into single scripts, reducing user effort. These scripts can be stored and executed whenever required, streamlining user interaction with the system.

Commonly used shell scripting commands include ls, cd, mkdir, rmdir, touch, rm, cp, mv, grep, sed, awk, find, chmod, chown, tar, ssh, scp, git, ansible, and docker. These commands automate tasks and facilitate DevOps processes, aiding in system management and code deployment.

### **Git Commands**  

### **What is Git?**

Git is a distributed version control system crucial in software development and DevOps. It enables collaborative work, tracks code changes and facilitates codebase management. Git's features such as branching and merging streamline code development and team collaboration.

### **Git Commands**

Essential Git commands used in DevOps workflows include clone, status, diff, add, commit, push, pull, branch, merge, and log. These commands empower DevOps teams in version tracking, code collaboration, and infrastructure management.

In summary, mastering Linux commands, shell scripting, and Git operations is integral for DevOps professionals. These tools and skills are vital for efficient system management, automation, and collaboration across the DevOps lifecycle.
