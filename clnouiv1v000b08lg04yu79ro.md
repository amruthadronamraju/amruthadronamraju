A web server is a fundamental component of the internet infrastructure responsible for storing and delivering the content of websites to users. This content can encompass various elements, including text, images, videos, and application data. When a user interacts with a website, such as clicking on a link or downloading a document, their web browser sends a request to the web server, which then responds by providing the requested content.

The primary means of communication between a web server and a web browser is through the use of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Most web pages are written in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), which serves as the standard format for structuring the content of web pages. This content can be broadly categorized as either static or dynamic. Static content includes fixed elements like text and images, while dynamic content is generated on the fly and can involve computed prices, shopping cart items, or personalized user experiences. To handle dynamic content, web servers often support server-side scripting languages that enable the incorporation of business logic into the communication. Examples of such languages include Active Server Pages (ASP), JavaScript, PHP, Python, and Ruby.

There are several web servers available, but four of the most prominent ones are:

1. Apache
    
2. Internet Information Services (IIS)
    
3. lighttpd
    
4. Jigsaw
    

Additionally, there are more options in the market, although they tend to be expensive. Some notable ones include Netscape's iPlanet, Bea's Web Logic, and IBM's WebSphere.

To illustrate the installation of a web server, let's consider the process of setting up the Nginx web server on an Ubuntu server. The steps involve:

1. Accessing your Ubuntu server via SSH or the server's terminal.
    
2. Updating the package repository with the command: \[sudo apt update\]
    
3. Installing Nginx using the command: \[sudo apt install nginx\]. During the installation, you might need to confirm it by typing 'Y' and pressing Enter.
    
4. Once the installation is complete, Nginx should be operational. You can confirm its status by running the command: \[sudo systemctl status nginx\]. If it's active and running, the status should be displayed as 'active (running).'
    

By default, Nginx starts automatically after installation. You can access the default Nginx landing page by entering your server's IP address or domain name in a web browser's address bar, such as '[http://server\_ip\_address](http://server_ip_address)' or '[http://domain\_name](http://domain_name).'
