1. **What is AWS Athena?**
    
    AWS Athena is a serverless interactive query service that enables the analysis of data stored in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. It allows users to execute SQL queries on data in S3 without the need to set up and manage infrastructure.
    
2. **What are the Features Of Athena?**
    
    AWS Athena offers the following features:
    
    * Easy Implementation: Accessible through AWS Console and AWS CLI.
        
        * Serverless: It manages infrastructure on its own.
            
        * Pay per query: Users are charged based on the amount of data scanned per query.
            
        * Fast: Optimizes query performance by breaking complex queries into simpler ones and running them in parallel.
            
        * Secure: Data is stored in S3 buckets, and access is controlled via IAM policies.
            
        * Highly available: Supports continuous query execution.
            
        * Integration: Enhances data versioning and provides features like tables and views.
            
3. **How can we create an Athena database and table?**
    
    Athena allows users to create a database and table by defining the schema and specifying the data location in S3. This can be achieved using SQL statements. For example:
    
    * To create a database: `CREATE DATABASE database_name;`
        
        * To create an external table: Define the table schema and location in S3.
            
4. **Is it possible to create user-defined functions in AWS Athena? If yes, then how?**
    
    Yes, user-defined functions (UDFs) can be created in AWS Athena using the `CREATE FUNCTION` command. This command allows users to specify the function name, input and output types, the function body, and any required parameters.
    
5. **What happens if you need to execute an ETL process on top of your existing data sets before loading them into AWS Athena?**
    
    To execute an ETL process before loading data into AWS Athena, you need to export your data sets from their current location into Amazon S3. Then, you can use AWS Glue to perform the necessary ETL operations to prepare the data in the required format for Athena.
    
6. **What are the differences between AWS Athena and Google BigQuery?**
    
    AWS Athena and Google BigQuery are both cloud-based data warehousing solutions. Key differences include:
    
    * AWS Athena is serverless, while BigQuery charges for storage and usage.
        
        * Athena uses the Presto query engine, while BigQuery uses BigQuery SQL.
            
        * Athena integrates with AWS services, while BigQuery integrates with Google Cloud services.
            
7. **How to tune your Performance of Athena?**
    
    * Performance tuning in Athena involves several techniques:
        
        * Data Partitioning: Divide tables into smaller parts based on column values like date, country, or region.
            
        * Bucketing Data: Partition data into a single bucket.
            
        * File Compression: Optimize file sizes for faster query execution.
            
        * Optimization of File Sizes: Use splittable file formats for parallel processing.
            
        * Optimization of Data Store Generation: Efficient data storage with compression and encoding.
            
        * Optimization of ORDER: Optimize the query results in sorted order.
