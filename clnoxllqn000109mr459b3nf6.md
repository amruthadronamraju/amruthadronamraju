27. Can I delete a particular version of a robot application or simulation application?  
    Yes, you can delete a specific version of a robot application or simulation application in AWS RoboMaker using the AWS Management Console or the AWS RoboMaker API. Deleting a version removes it permanently, along with associated resources, so it should be done carefully to avoid data loss.
    
28. When do I restart a simulation job?  
    You might consider restarting a simulation job in AWS RoboMaker for various reasons, such as debugging or troubleshooting, updating the simulation application or virtual robot, changing simulation settings, or aiming to improve performance. However, be aware that restarting a job might lead to the loss of any data or progress made in the previous run.
    
29. Explain how database transactions are implemented at the system level. Database transactions are implemented at the system level using a technique called two-phase locking. This involves acquiring locks on data that a transaction intends to modify during the growing phase. Once all locks are acquired, the transaction enters the shrinking phase and releases locks as it completes its work. This mechanism ensures data integrity, preventing simultaneous modifications and maintaining a consistent database state.
    
30. What is your Approach to Debugging?  
    Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing code errors. Common debugging approaches include systematic problem elimination, using debugging tools, and reviewing logs and metrics for clues. In AWS RoboMaker, debugging involves checking logs and monitoring metrics, as well as testing in simulation before physical deployment. Effective debugging is crucial for maintaining code quality and reliability.
