1. **What is AWS Glue?**
    
    AWS Glue is a managed service for ETL (extract, transform, load) that simplifies the process of categorizing, cleaning, enriching, and moving data between different data storage and data streaming systems. It includes the AWS Glue Data Catalog, an ETL engine that can automatically generate Python or Scala code, and a customizable scheduler for managing job dependencies, monitoring, and retries. AWS Glue is serverless, meaning there is no need to manage infrastructure.
    
2. **Describe AWS Glue Architecture**
    
    AWS Glue's architecture involves creating tasks for ETL operations, such as extracting, transforming, and loading data from a source to a target. Crawlers are used to populate the AWS Glue Data Catalog with metadata about data sources. The Data Catalog contains information about tables and data stream characteristics. Users can define and modify Data Catalog tables and data stream attributes, and AWS Glue can generate data transformation scripts. Jobs can be executed immediately or triggered by events. When a job runs, it extracts data from the source, applies transformations, and loads it into the target using an Apache Spark environment.
    
3. **What are the use cases of AWS Glue?**
    
    AWS Glue is used for various use cases, including:
    
    * Data extraction: Extracting data in different formats.
