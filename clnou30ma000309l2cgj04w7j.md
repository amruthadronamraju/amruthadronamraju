Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is an AWS service for renting virtual servers in the cloud, offering scalability and flexibility without physical hardware investment.

Advantages:

1. Elasticity and Scalability
    
2. Pay-as-You-Go Pricing
    
3. Flexibility in OS and Software
    
4. High Availability and Reliability
    
5. Security and Compliance
    
6. Integration with Other AWS Services

IAM (Identity and Access Management) in AWS allows you to control access to resources. Users are individuals or apps with unique credentials. Groups organize users for common permissions. Roles delegate access to AWS resources.

Deploying a Basic Web Application on AWS involves compute, storage, databases, networking, content delivery, identity management, monitoring, and automation services.

The AWS Management Console is a web-based interface for managing AWS services.

AWS CLI (Command Line Interface) is a tool to interact with AWS services via the command line.

Conclusion:  
In conclusion, Amazon EC2 provides scalable and flexible cloud-based virtual servers, offering various advantages such as elasticity, cost-effectiveness, and security. IAM in AWS helps manage access to resources through users, groups, and roles. Deploying a web application on AWS involves a range of services, and the AWS Management Console and AWS CLI provide user-friendly interfaces for managing AWS resources.
