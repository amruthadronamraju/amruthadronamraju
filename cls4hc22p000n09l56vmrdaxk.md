**Introduction:**

AWS DevOps, a suite of tools and services from Amazon Web Services (AWS), facilitates the implementation of DevOps practices in the cloud. This approach streamlines software delivery processes and infrastructure management, resulting in enhanced speed, reliability, and scalability in software development.

**Key DevOps Tools and Services on AWS:**

1. Code Development and Version Control: AWS offers CodeCommit, a secure and scalable Git repository service that fosters collaboration among teams for code development and version control.
    
2. Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): CodePipeline, a fully managed continuous delivery service, automates the software release process, enabling teams to build, test, and deploy code changes efficiently.
    
3. Infrastructure as Code: CloudFormation allows teams to create and manage AWS resources through code, promoting automation in infrastructure creation and management.
    
4. Configuration Management: AWS Config and Systems Manager assist in managing and monitoring AWS resources at scale, offering detailed inventory and a unified interface for configuration.
    
5. Monitoring and Logging: CloudWatch provides real-time monitoring and logging for AWS resources, offering visibility into application and infrastructure performance.
    
6. Security and Compliance: AWS provides services such as IAM for secure resource access management and KMS for creating and managing encryption keys, ensuring robust security and compliance.
    

**Additional AWS DevOps Tools and Services:**

1. Elastic Beanstalk: A fully managed service for deploying and scaling web applications automatically.
    
2. Lambda: A serverless computing service for running code without server management.
    
3. EC2 Container Service: A scalable container management service for deploying, running, and scaling applications using containers.
    
4. X-Ray: A service for analyzing and debugging distributed applications in microservices architectures.
    
5. OpsWorks: A configuration management service automating deployment and management of applications on AWS.
