    * SQL queries: Execute SQL queries to monitor disk space within the database, using queries tailored to the database engine (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
        
    
    The best method depends on your specific needs and preferences, and a combination of methods can provide a comprehensive view of disk space usage.
    
7. **What are the differences between RDS, DynamoDB, and RedShift?**  
    RDS, DynamoDB, and RedShift are AWS database services with key differences:
    
    * Data model: RDS is for relational databases, DynamoDB for NoSQL, and RedShift for data warehousing.
        
    * Query language: RDS and RedShift use SQL, while DynamoDB uses a proprietary query language.
        
    * Use cases: RDS suits traditional databases, DynamoDB is for low-latency applications, and RedShift is for large-scale data warehousing and analytics.
        
    
    Choose the service that aligns with your application's needs.
    
8. **What is an RDS DB instance?**  
    An RDS DB instance is a logical database server in AWS's RDS service. It runs a specific database engine (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and stores data on disk. It consists of compute and memory capacity and can be provisioned with varying storage capacity. RDS DB instances handle tasks like patching, backups, and recovery, allowing users to focus on building applications.
    
9. **Which database engines are supported with Amazon RDS?**  
    Amazon RDS supports various database engines, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server, in addition to Amazon Aurora and Amazon DocumentDB. These options allow users to choose the database engine that best fits their requirements.
    
10. **What is the maximum number of DB instances a user can run with Amazon RDS?**  
    The maximum number of DB instances a user can run with Amazon RDS depends on the database engine, instance type, and configuration. For instance, with MySQL, you can run up to 20 DB instances per Availability Zone, and you can run up to 40 DB instances in total if you deploy across multiple Availability Zones. However, the maximum number varies for different database engines and instance types.
    
11. **Is it possible for a user to have multiple databases on RDS?**  
    Yes, it is possible to create multiple databases within a single Amazon RDS instance. You can use SQL commands or management tools to create and manage these databases independently within the RDS instance.
