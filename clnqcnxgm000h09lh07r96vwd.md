1. **What is the AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT)?**
    
    The AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT) is a tool provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) designed to aid in the migration of databases to Amazon Aurora or other databases in the AWS Cloud. It streamlines the process of converting database schemas and migrating data, making it more efficient and convenient to transfer a database to the cloud.
    
2. **How does the SCT help with database migrations to Amazon Aurora or other databases in the AWS Cloud?**
    
    The SCT assists with database migrations to Amazon Aurora or other databases in the AWS Cloud by automating the conversion of database schemas and data migration. It can evaluate the source database schema, identify any issues or compatibility problems, and offer recommendations for the migration process. It can also generate the necessary SQL scripts and other required artifacts to facilitate the migration.
    
3. **What types of database schemas can the SCT convert?**
    
    The SCT is capable of converting database schemas for various database engines, including Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.
    
4. **Can the SCT convert stored procedures, functions, and triggers? If so, how does it handle the conversion of these database objects?**
    
    Yes, the SCT can convert stored procedures, functions, triggers, and other database objects such as views and sequences. It achieves this by generating the requisite SQL scripts to recreate these objects in the target database and providing recommendations for any changes necessary to ensure compatibility with the target database.
    
5. **How does the SCT handle data type conversions during the schema migration process?**
    
    The SCT addresses data type conversions during the schema migration process by examining the source database schema to identify any data types that are incompatible with the target database. It then offers recommendations for handling the migration, such as modifying data types or using suitable data type mapping rules.
    
6. **Can the SCT be used to migrate a database from on-premises to the AWS Cloud, or is it only for migrating between different database engines in the cloud?**
    
    The SCT can be employed for migrating a database from on-premises to the AWS Cloud, as well as for migrating between different database engines in the cloud.
    
7. **Can the SCT be used to migrate a database from one AWS region to another?**
    
    Yes, the SCT can be used to migrate a database from one AWS region to another.
    
8. **Does the SCT support incremental migrations, or does it require a full-database migration each time?**
    
    The SCT supports both full-database migrations and incremental migrations, depending on the user's requirements. Incremental migrations enable users to migrate only the data that has changed since the last migration, which can be advantageous in terms of time and resource efficiency.
    
9. **How does the SCT handle conflicts or errors that may arise during the schema migration process?**
    
    The SCT manages conflicts or errors that may arise during the schema migration process by offering recommendations and suggestions for resolving these issues. It can also generate SQL scripts that can be used to address any problems encountered during the migration.
    
10. **Are there any limitations to using the SCT for database migrations?**
    
    There are some limitations to using the SCT for database migrations. For example, it may not fully automate the migration process for certain complex database schemas or configurations, necessitating manual intervention. Additionally, the SCT may not support all possible data types or database features, and modifications to the source database schema may be required to ensure compatibility with the target database.
